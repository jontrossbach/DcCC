List of challenges for the lab report (to be growed):

1. While the official mininet VM uses python2 and OF1.0 by default, we find Ryu is distributed with more recent
   versions of python and OF protocol.
   
   We decided to use python3 and OF1.3, but apply minimal changes to the old configured environment, which is the virtualbox mininet VM, and be able to use our local machine as a remote controller. So we started to install Ryu in python3 and seek a way of reconciling it with an mininet app. Here are what we did:
   a. Knowing that OF1.3 is supported but requires enabled by mininet, we figured out the way to specify the OF protocol version either via mn launch tool or by running a script file.
   b. We learn Ryu API through the official OF1.3 examples, and tested successfully with py2 OVSSwitches connected to a py3 Ryu controller. So that no need to reconfigure a new environment for mininet.
